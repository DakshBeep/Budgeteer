# Next-gen Budgeteer UI

This is a very small React scaffold demonstrating how a dedicated front-end could interact with the existing FastAPI backend.

```
# install dependencies
npm install

# start dev server
npm start
```

The app supports login, adding a transaction and listing transactions using Material UI components.
