# Budgeteer App Evaluation and Recommendations

This document provides an assessment of the current Budgeteer prototype and suggests possible improvements. It reviews the user experience, code quality, performance, architectural decisions and how the project aligns with typical YC-style product strategy.

## 1. User Experience (UX)

The Streamlit interface keeps everything on a single page and is easy to understand. Registration and login are straightforward, but after registering the user must manually log in, which could be smoother. Adding a transaction refreshes the page so the new entry appears instantly, although the form resets each time. It would help to remember the last date or category for faster repeated entry.

Categories are pre-defined which simplifies data entry, but users may not realize expenses should be negative numbers. Clarifying this with a note or automatically treating certain categories as expenses would prevent inconsistent data. Recurring transactions are supported and show up in a separate "Upcoming" list, though they also appear in the main table which can be confusing. Filtering them out of the main list would keep the ledger cleaner.

Visual feedback consists of a running balance line chart and a donut chart of categories. These give quick insight but mix income and expenses in a single pie chart, which might be misleading. A separate view for income vs expenses or a bar chart could help. Forecasting is available with multiple model options, but the technical terms may overwhelm new users. Using a single default model and hiding advanced choices behind an "Advanced" toggle would be friendlier.

Overall the UX is minimal and mostly intuitive, but small touches like clearer instructions, delete/edit options, and refined visualizations would make the app feel more polished.

## 2. Code Quality

The codebase is short and readable. FastAPI with SQLModel provides clear models and validation and Streamlit keeps the UI simple. Most logic lives directly in the endpoint functions. Error handling in the UI could be better because it assumes every request succeeds. Configuration values such as the JWT secret are hardcoded and would be better as environment variables. Splitting the backend into separate modules (auth, transactions, forecasting) would improve maintainability as the project grows. Adding tests would help ensure core features keep working as the code evolves.

## 3. Performance

For a small dataset performance is fine. Streamlit reruns the whole script on each interaction which reloads all data from the API; caching results could improve responsiveness. Heavy forecasting libraries are imported even if the user never uses them. Loading them lazily only when needed would reduce memory usage. SQLite is adequate for a demo but would not scale to many concurrent users.

## 4. Architecture and Design Decisions

The project uses a simple FastAPI backend with a Streamlit frontend. This is great for quick iteration but Streamlit may not be ideal for a polished product. If the user base grows, a more conventional web or mobile UI might be needed along with a production database. The backend is generally well-designed for an MVP and can be extended or refactored incrementally.

## 5. Productâ€“Startup Fit

Budgeteer demonstrates a lean approach with enough features to test whether users want a simpler budgeting tool. The focus should remain on iterating quickly based on real user feedback. Deploying a hosted version or providing an easy way to try the app will help gather that feedback. Advanced features such as multiple forecasting models should not distract from delivering immediate value to users.

## Conclusion

Budgeteer does not need a full rewrite. Instead, the project can be improved step by step: polish the UX, refactor the backend for modularity, add tests and configuration options, and consider a more robust UI framework when the time comes. These incremental improvements will let the team keep moving fast while gradually building a reliable product.
